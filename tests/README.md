## **Instructions for running the experiments**
Demo experiments can be found in the tests folder under the installation path (Default installation path: D:\PerceptionVnV):  

- Make sure that you have a copy of Webots.  
- For a Covering Array simulations, go to "iv2018_exp1" folder and execute: "python iv2018_exp1.py" in a command prompt.  
- For executing all falsification experiments, open Matlab in "iv2018_exp1" folder and execute "run_all.m"  

### Important Notes:  
Matlab runs will rely on absolute paths for finding scripts and logging (large) data files. 
If the installation path is different than the default, please check *.m scripts and change absolute paths that start with :D:\PerceptionVnV". 
You can furthermore turn on/off data logging in those scripts.  

Thanks!
